# wordle_solver

Pretty basic wordle solver. I first load in all of the words and score them based off the letters they use and the frequency of these letters in the whole dataset of 5 letter words. 

In main while loop asks for user input (1 for letter in word but incorrect pos, 0 for incorrect letter, and 2 for correct letter and pos). Returns the valid word that fits the input with the highest score. This program does not interface directly with the wordle website. Instead, it still requires manual inputs of the letters into the wordle website. 

-Hardcoded to start with the word 'roast'
